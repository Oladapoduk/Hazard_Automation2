### Revit Hazard Automation Plugin

This project is a C# implementation for creating Revit plugins that automate hazard analysis within the Revit software. The plugin aims to streamline the process of identifying and mitigating potential hazards in architectural designs by leveraging the power of Revit's Building Information Modeling (BIM) capabilities.

Features
The Revit Hazard Automation Plugin provides the following features:

Hazard Identification: The plugin analyzes the architectural design within Revit to identify potential hazards, such as inadequate fire protection, unsafe structural elements, or poor accessibility.

Automated Hazard Mitigation: Based on the identified hazards, the plugin suggests automated mitigation measures, such as adding fire-rated materials, reinforcing structural elements, or improving accessibility features.

Interactive User Interface: The plugin offers a user-friendly interface within the Revit environment, allowing users to interact with the hazard analysis results, review suggestions, and apply mitigation measures.

Customizable Rules: The plugin allows users to define custom hazard analysis rules based on specific project requirements. This feature ensures flexibility and adaptability to various architectural designs and hazard types.

Reporting and Documentation: The plugin generates detailed reports and documentation summarizing the hazard analysis process, identified hazards, and implemented mitigation measures. This facilitates communication and collaboration among project stakeholders.
